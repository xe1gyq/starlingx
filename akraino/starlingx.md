## Blueprint

- Akraino uses the “blueprint” concept to address specific Edge use cases to support an end-to-end solution.
- A blueprint is a declarative configuration of the entire stack-- i.e., edge platform that can support edge workloads and edge APIs.
- To address specific use cases, a blueprint architecture is developed by thecommunity and a declarative configuration is used to define all the components used within that architecture such as hardware, software, tools to manage the entire stack, and method of deployment (Blueprints aremaintained using full CI/CD integration and testing by the community for ready download and install).
